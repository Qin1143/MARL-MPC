CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvoid_ptr.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "void_ptr",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "void_ptr" with any
  of the following names:

    void_ptrConfig.cmake
    void_ptr-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "void_ptr" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "void_ptr_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "void_ptr" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
