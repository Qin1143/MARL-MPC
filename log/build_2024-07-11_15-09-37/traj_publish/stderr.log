CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "eigen", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eigen" with any of
  the following names:

    eigenConfig.cmake
    eigen-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "eigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "eigen"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
